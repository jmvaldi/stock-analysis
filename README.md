# Stock Analysis with Microsoft Excel VBA
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor a Microsoft Excel Visual Basics for Applications (VBA) code to go over and collect information from 12 different stocks from the years 2017 and 2018. With this refactor we have a better idea as to whether or not invest in said stocks.
### Results
#### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code in General
The purpose of refactoring is to restructure the software code to become more concise and user friendly. You can clean up your code and find bugs more easily in other words easier maintenance. This also allows other users to navigate your work. There are still shortcomings when it comes to refactoring, coding applications that are too large will become a challenge to navigate through if the user doesnâ€™t fully understand what is going on. Refactoring is used to modify codes, not add functionality. Another disadvantage is the time being spent refactoring could cut into productivity time when the data is large. It is advised to perform refactoring in smaller doses. 
#### Advantages and Disadvanatges of the Original and refactored VBA script
The original VBA script that was used to analyze the DQ stock worked well because the script went over just one of the twelve stocks. Continuing to analyze the other eleven stocks in this manner would have taken up more productivity time and result in a large amount of data to navigate. For the year 2017 the data was compiled within 0.4609375 seconds and for the year 2018 it was compiled in 0.453125. 
By performing refactoring to all the stocks data, the VBA script was able to compile the data significantly faster. For the year 2017 the timing was 0.1015626 and for the year 2018 it was 0.109375, this method shaved off about 0.35 seconds from the original VBA script.
